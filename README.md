## What is pipq?

pipq is a command-line security tool designed to enhance the safety of Python package installations. Acting as an intermediary between users and pip, pipq intercepts package installation requests, performs comprehensive security analyses, and provides actionable insights or blocks potentially harmful packages based on configurable policies. This tool is particularly valuable for developers, DevOps teams, and organizations seeking to mitigate risks associated with supply chain attacks, malware, and other security vulnerabilities in the Python ecosystem.

> [!WARNING]
> pipq is experimental and offers no API or CLI compatibility guarantees.

## Key Features

pipq offers a robust suite of security validations to protect against various threats:

### Package Analysis
- **Typosquatting Detection**: Identifies packages with names similar to popular ones, which may be malicious imitations.
- **Package Age Validation**: Flags newly created packages that could indicate supply chain attacks or very old packages lacking updates.
- **Maintainer Analysis**: Assesses maintainer profiles, highlighting risks from single-maintainer packages.
- **License Validation**: Ensures packages have valid, non-problematic licenses.
- **Integrity Validation**: Verifies package integrity using SHA256 hashes against PyPI metadata.
- **Provenance Analysis**: Checks for valid source repositories and adherence to modern packaging standards (e.g., `pyproject.toml`).
- **Static Code Analysis**: Scans source code for dangerous patterns like `eval()`, `exec()`, and suspicious API usage without executing code.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Queries databases like OSV for known vulnerabilities.
- **Malware Scanning**: Scans for suspicious code patterns and uses the VirusTotal API to detect known malware.
- **Dependency Analysis**: Checks for circular dependencies and an excessive number of dependencies.
- **Cryptographic Signature Verification**: Verifies GPG signatures and checks for the presence of modern TUF and Sigstore signatures.

### User Experience
- Rich terminal interface with color-coded output and progress indicators.
- Interactive prompts for security decisions.
- Multiple operation modes: `interactive`, `silent`, or `block`.
- Comprehensive configuration via TOML files and environment variables.
