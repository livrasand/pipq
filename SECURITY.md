# Security Policy

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

The security of `pipq` users and contributors is a top priority. We follow a responsible disclosure process to ensure that any vulnerabilities are reported, triaged, and remediated privately before public disclosure. This process helps protect users from exposure to unpatched vulnerabilities and maintains the integrity of the open-source ecosystem.

We kindly ask all researchers and contributors to avoid any activity that could harm users, compromise systems, or disrupt services. Responsible, ethical testing and reporting are essential to maintain a safe and secure project.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security issue in `pipq`, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**. Instead, contact the maintainers directly using:

* **GitHub Security Advisory:** [Create a private security advisory](https://github.com/livrasand/pipq/security/advisories/new)

Please include as much detail as possible to help us reproduce and verify the issue:

* Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
* Affected versions or configurations
* Possible impact and severity
* Suggested fix or mitigation, if available

We aim to acknowledge valid reports within **72 hours**, provide an initial assessment within **7 days**, and release a patch or mitigation as soon as reasonably possible.

## Disclosure Process

1. The vulnerability report is received and reviewed privately.
2. The maintainers validate and assess the severity and impact.
3. A fix is developed and tested internally.
4. A new release is published, and users are advised to update.
5. The vulnerability is disclosed publicly after a fix is available.

Your efforts to **responsibly disclose vulnerabilities** help protect the community and strengthen the security of the Python ecosystem.
Contributors who report security issues in good faith will be recognized for their responsible disclosure and contribution to open-source safety.

**Thank you for helping keep `pipq` and the Python ecosystem secure.**
