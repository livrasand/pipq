"""A placeholder validator for detecting pre- and post-installation scripts.

The ability for packages to run arbitrary code during installation (e.g., in
`setup.py`) is a significant security risk in the Python ecosystem. This
validator is intended to detect the presence of such scripts, which would
allow users to be aware of and potentially block packages that use them.
